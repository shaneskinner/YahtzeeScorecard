YahtzeeScorecard
================

Future personal project idea. Create a mobile app of a Yahtzee scorecard so players can play a live game (aka with actual dice) but keep score on their mobile device. This will eliminate wasted paper and the need to purchase more scoresheets for people who use the app.
